Complete selection of autograded CSS exercises, for anyone interested in learning CSS!

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/css-layouts-tutorial-exercises) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/css-layouts-tutorial-exercises.git).

> Once you have VSCode open the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local installation

[Clone the repository](https://4geeks.com/how-to/github-clone-repository) in your local environment and follow the steps below:

1. Install LearnPack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the HTML compiler plugin for LearnPack, make sure you also have node.js 14+:

```bash
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-html
```

2. Download these particular exercises using LearnPack and `cd` into the folder:

```bash
$ learnpack download css-layouts-tutorial-exercises
$ cd css-layouts-tutorial-exercises
```

> Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find an "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```bash
$ npm i jest@24.8.0 -g
$ learnpack start
```

<!-- endhide -->

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small React application containing the following files:

1. **index.html:** your HTML code goes here.
2. **styles.css:** your CSS code goes here.
3. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
4. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading, but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion, or you may get frustrated.
