# `09` Beautify

This is a real-life example sponsored by one of our students; in this case, they were trying to make their website look like this:

![beautify](../../.learn/assets/09-Beauty.png?raw=true)

However, the code contains several errors that prevent it from displaying correctly. Your task is to **fix the HTML and CSS** so that it meets the following technical requirements.

- Display **6 visible boxes** (`div`), each with a number from 1 to 6 inside a `<strong>` tag.
- Each box must have a unique `id`: `div1`, `div2`, ..., `div6`.
- All `div`s must have **exact dimensions** and **specific background colors**.
- Some boxes must have `border-radius` and custom text color.


## üìù Instructions:

1. Each `div` must be `150px` wide and `100px` high.
2. `div1` and `div5` must have a **red background**.
3. `div2` and `div4` must have a **blue background**.
4. `div3` must have a **yellow background**.
5. `div6` must have a **black background**.
6. `div2`, `div3`, `div5`, and `div6` must have **white text** and `border-radius: 25px`.
7. `div1` and `div4` must have `border-radius: 50px`.
8. Each `div` must contain a number from 1 to 6, wrapped in a `<strong>` tag.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

Do not remove or modify the `<head>` elements such as `<meta>`, `<title>`, or `<link>`.
