# `07` Sidebar

To replicate a sidebar, all you have to do is place 2 boxes in the same line using the `flex` property, make sure to wrap them in a parent `div`.

Create a left sidebar and a main content, just like this:

![Sidebar](../../.learn/assets/69N2q6G.png?raw=true)

## 📝 Instructions:
1. The wrapper should have a height of `100px`
2. The content should have a width of `100%`

## 💡 Hint:

Only add or update the CSS styles, you don't need more HTML.
