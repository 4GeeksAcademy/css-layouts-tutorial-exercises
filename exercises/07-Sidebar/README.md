# `07` Sidebar

To Create a sidebar, all you have to do is place 2 boxes in the same line using the `flex` property, make sure to wrap them in a parent `div`.

Create a left sidebar should have a width of X (maybe '30%') and the main content page should have the rest of the full window with, just like this:

![Sidebar](../../.learn/assets/69N2q6G.png?raw=true)

## 📝 Instructions:
1. The wrapper should have a height of `100px` and a width of `100%`
2. The sidebar should have a width of `30%`
3. The content should have a width of `70%`

## 💡 Hint:

Only add or update the CSS styles, you don't need more HTML.
