# `10` Static Layout 

Apply the necessary styles to `.wrapper`,`.secondWrapper`, `<header>`, `<nav>` and `<section>` to make the website look like the image.

## 📝 Instructions:
1. `.secondWrapper` should be a flex container. You should use `display: flex` for that.

## 💡 Hints: 

- Don't change anything on the HTML.

- The `section` container has approximately a width of `80%`.

- All gaps between containers are `10px`. For example, there is a `10px` space between the `nav` container and the `section` container, and also between the `section` container and the right side of the page.

- This exercise does not have tests, compare your result with the image example.

## 💻 Expected result:
