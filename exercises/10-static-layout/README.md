# `10` Static Layout

In this exercise, you will work with static positioning and distribution using `flexbox` and other basic CSS properties. The goal is to build a simple but properly aligned page layout, where the main elements are distributed with specific margins and widths.

The HTML is already structured with the following classes and elements:

- `.wrapper` (main container)
- `.secondWrapper` (container for `nav` and `section`)
- `<header>`
- `<nav>`
- `<section>`


## üìù Instructions:

1. Apply `display: flex` to the `.secondWrapper` container so its child elements are arranged in a row (horizontally).
2. The `<section>` element should take up approximately `80%` of the width of `.secondWrapper`.
3. The `<nav>` should be positioned to the left of the `<section>`.
4. Make sure there is a `10px` space:
    - Between `<nav>` and `<section>`.
    - Between `<section>` and the right edge of the container.
5. The layout should remain stable, without using `position: absolute` or `float`.

## üí° Tips:

- Do not modify the HTML file.
- Use properties like `gap`, `margin`, `padding`, `width`, `flex`, etc.
- If you use `gap`, make sure it is applied to the appropriate container.
- You can use temporary background colors to visualize the blocks while working.
- This exercise has no tests; compare your result with the given image.
